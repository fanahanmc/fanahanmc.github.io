## Monte Carlo Simulation of the English Premier League (Python)

This project explores the use of various Machine Learning algorithms in developing a model capable of simulating fixtures from the English Premier League over multiple seasons while achieving realistic results. The simulation of various betting models is also carried out, with the aim of evaluating the effect of different factors on overall profitability.

The project code is written in Python, within a Jupyer Notebook.

To take a quick look at the project, you can click on the following [HTML link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fanahanmc/epl-monte-carlo-sim/blob/master/HTML_files/ACM40960_Project_20203868.html). Alternatively, you can navigate to the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fanahanmc/epl-monte-carlo-sim) if you would like to run the code yourself.

## Football Trajectory Modelling and Simulation (Mathematica)

In this project, the trajectory of a football is modelled based on frames from a given video, using both object recognition and image processing techniques. The modelled trajectory is then simulated using a number of different visualisations, and estimates of speed, maximum height reached and total distance travelled are also calculated.

Mathematica was used to develop this project, a very powerful mathematical computer program capable of generating complex interactive plots and visualisations. If you are lucky enough to have access to Mathatica, then you can find the Mathematica notebook and all image and video files used for the project in the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fanahanmc/football-flight-model-sim). Otherwise, you can view a PDF of the project notebook at the [following link](https://fanahanmc.github.io/PDF_files/ACM40730_Project_static.pdf), although without the interactive plotting capabilites.
